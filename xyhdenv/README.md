# XY + Head Direction Environment

xyhdenv is adapted from [FWorld](https://github.com/emer/envs/tree/master/fworld).  It is designed for developing navigation models that require only simple inputs like location, orientation, and vestibular info.

It simply contains 4 walls at the edges of the environment, and the rest of the environment if blank.
